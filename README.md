# Docmaps RFC Process

This repository is for discussing and proposing changes to the Docmaps project.

## What is an RFC?

RFC stands for "Request For Comments." It is a proposal document that outlines a new feature, change or improvement to the Docmaps project. RFCs are used to start a discussion about a proposed change and to get feedback from the community before any code is written.

## How to submit an RFC

1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Create a new branch for your proposal.
3. Create a new file in the `proposals` directory with the name of your proposal.
4. Copy and paste the RFC template into the new file.
5. Fill out the template with your proposal details.
6. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.
7. The pull request template includes a place to copy a link to the `tree` Github-rendered markdown where your proposal can be found. Make sure to include this. It's easier than reading git diffs!

## RFC Template

```
# RFC Title

## Abstract

[Concise summary of the issue and resolution]

## Problem

[Describe the problem you are trying to solve]

## Proposed Solution

[Describe your proposed solution to the problem]

## Alternatives Considered

[Describe any alternative solutions you considered]

## Security and Privacy Considerations

[Describe any alternative solutions you considered]

## Implementation Notes

[Describe how you plan to implement your proposed solution]

## References and links

```

## What happens after I submit an RFC?

After you submit an RFC, it will be reviewed by the Docmaps team. They will provide feedback and ask questions about your proposal as Pull request Commentary. The community is also encouraged to participate in the discussion.

If your proposal is accepted, the PR is merged and the proposal will live long-term in this repo.
You will then probably need to work with the Docmaps team to implement the changes.
If your proposal is not accepted, you are encouraged to revise your proposal and resubmit it.
